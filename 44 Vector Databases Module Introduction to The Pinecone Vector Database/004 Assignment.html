<p>Your task is to create a new index with 1536 dimensions and a similarity metric that is different than cosine.</p><p>Ideally you would use Python code to do so, but at this stage you may also use Pinecone.io if thatâ€™s easier. Feel free to experiment with both options, and create and delete multiple indexes to get a better feel of the project.</p>
