<p>For the next lesson, please make sure that the "emotion-labels-train.csv", "emotion-labels-test.csv", and "emotion-labels-val.csv" files are placed in a folder called "emotions_data". The folder must be located in the same directory as your active Jupyter notebook. This will help ensure that the files are accessed without any errors.</p>
